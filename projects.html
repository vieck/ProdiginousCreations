        <div id="Purdue App">
            <h2 class="project-name">Purdue Weather App</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I am currently working on the weather app for Purdue's Association for Applied Computing.
            This gives me a chance to test different Android development techniques and make design an app
            however I like. Since I have not built the UI portion of it yet though, I only have the code to show.</p>

        <div id="Website">
            <h2 class="project-name">This Website</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Believe it or not, this website was a project in and of itself.
                I made the company logo you see above and the layout was all custom designed.
            If you're curious, I built my website using the Jekyll framework which you can see the code for here: <a href="https://github.com/vieck/vieck.github.io">Source Code</a></p>
