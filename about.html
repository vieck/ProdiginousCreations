    <h1 class="project-name">What is Prodiginous Creations?</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">Prodigionus Creations is a branding name that represents
    the culmination of all the work I have put into programming. Think of this site
    as both a showcase and a personal website for the various projects I have completed.</p>

    <h1 class="project-name">So What Actually Goes On At This Site?</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">I blog once and awhile here as well as update my any new projects I create.</p>

    <div class="about-me">
        <p class="paragraph">An up and coming student studying computer science at Purdue,
        Michael Vieck is an aspiring young teacher willing to go above and beyond to help his students.
        Since Michael is a current student, he has access to all the up to date information
        on what companies need from developers as well as being able to convert this data into videos.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="project-name">Some of my skill sets include:</h2>
        <ol class="skills-list">
            <li>Java programming</li>
            <li>Practical Web Design</li>
            <li>Android Application Development</li>
            <li>Graphical Design</li>
            <li>Mobile Operating Systems</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">In addition to coding, I also teach students over at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/u/michaelvieck/">Udemy.</a>
            I enjoy teaching there because it enables me to extend my knowledge to students from all around the world!
            Currently I only have a course on Java made, but I plan on creating one over Jekyll web design and Android programming
            in the near future.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">When i'm not coding or creating more videos,
            you can usually find me in the Purdue libraries reading up on current technology trends and classical literature.
                If you use Steam and have played any of the Call of Duty Zombies, 
                there's also a good chance that you've played a match with me.
