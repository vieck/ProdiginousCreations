I suppose I should extend the red carpet for you discovering my blog! Since this is my first post,
I'll discuss what plans I have for this site and any future updates on the way.

What's In Store
---------------
I have lots of big plans for this website. 
Firstly, it will showcase all of my projects including any new apps I create, so stay tuned!
Secondly, I will also be hosting my classes from Udemy here. If you don't know what Udemy is,
it is a paid video publication site that teaches students a skill. It is quite similar to YouTube,
however the main difference is the quality of content and videos hosted on Udemy. You can check out
my profile over <a href="https://www.udemy.com/u/michaelvieck/">here</a> and see if you would like to sign up.
